IETF and IEEE protocols for low-power power and lossy networks target the consumer IoT, where security and reliability requirements are relaxed. Industrial and medical applications, however, require more secure and more reliable protocols. For such applications, this repo implements the following protocol stack:

# OSCORE-NG: Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments Next-Generation

OSCORE-NG is the most secure end-to-end security solution for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Please see [libcoap](https://github.com/kkrentz/libcoap), for the code and further information.

# IRAP: Implicit Remote Attestation Protocol

IRAP establishes an [OSCORE-NG](https://github.com/kkrentz/libcoap) session between a client and a server. As its key exchange protocol, IRAP adopts Fully Hashed Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (FHMQV), which saves communication and processing overhead compared to Diffie-Hellman.

Optionally, IRAP can establish attested channels, where the client, the server, or both are ensured of the other side's software and optionally even hardware integrity. This functionality is based on TinyDICE, a lightweight version of the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE), which, in turn, is a standard for implementing measured boot without TPMs.

IRAP comprises three CoAP request-response pairs:
1. The initial /kno request-response is part of IRAP's protection against denial-of-service and amplification attacks.
2. The subsequent /reg request-response performs an FHMQV key exchange and optionally the TinyDICE-based remote attestation.
3. The final request-response pair serves for key confirmation and can carry OSCORE-NG-protected application data already.

# SMOR: Secure Multipath Opportunistic Routing

Many state-of-the-art IoT technologies, such as Thread or Wi-SUN, employ the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which is particularly vulnerable to compromised nodes. Our SMOR, by contrast, tolerates compromises of single nodes. Also, SMOR improves on RPL’s delays and packet delivery ratios.

¹ Failures of root nodes prevent network formation

² As RPL does not assess unused links, it may miss opportunities to migrate to better links

³ IPv6 packets may take detours via a root node or a common ancestor

# CSL: Coordinated Sampled Listening

CSL is a standardized MAC protocol for IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Its rationale is to send a stream of wake-up frames prior to an actual payload frame. Each wake-up frame announces the remaining time until the transmission of the payload frame. This hint enables the receiver of a wake-up frame to sleep until the transmission of the payload frame is about to begin.

## Configuration

An example configuration can be found in [examples/akes/csl](examples/akes/csl). There are two main ways to use our CSL implementation. First, it is possible to adhere to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, owing to security vulnerabilities (even when enabling IEEE 802.15.4 security), this configuration is only meant for testing and research purposes. Second, it is possible to enable additional security measures.

### IEEE 802.15.4-Compliant CSL

For the standards-compliant configuration, add the following line to your `project-conf.h`
```c
/* auto-configures the MAC layer */
#include "net/mac/csl/csl-autoconf.inc"
```

Finally, in your Makefile, insert:
```
MAKE_MAC = MAKE_MAC_CSL
```

### Hasso Plattner Institute MAC (HPI-MAC)

For the secure configuration, aka HPI-MAC, add the following two lines to your `project-conf.h`:
```c
#define CSL_CONF_COMPLIANT 0
#include "net/mac/csl/csl-autoconf.inc"
```
and the following lines to your Makefile:
```c
MAKE_MAC = MAKE_MAC_CSL
MODULES += os/services/akes
```

For better reliability (at the cost of higher latencies and RAM usage), enable ML-based channel hopping:
```c
#define CSL_CHANNEL_SELECTOR_CONF_WITH_D_UCB 1
```
Fewer channels can be configured to trade-off between reliability, latencies, and RAM usage:

```c
/* a subset of { 11, 12, ..., 26 } containing 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 channels, such as: */
#define CSL_CONF_CHANNELS { 12, 16, 20, 24 }
```

### Troubleshooting

Two parameters might need adaption to your radio environment:

```c
/* If the CCA threshold is too low, IEEE 802.15.4 nodes may end up sending never. */
#define CSL_CONF_CCA_THRESHOLD (-70) /* dBm */
/* The output power controls the communication range. */
#define CSL_CONF_OUTPUT_POWER (0) /* dBm */
```

## Features

HPI-MAC features:
- Low base energy consumption - HPI-MAC wakes up eight times per second, yielding a duty cycle of 0.5%
- Low energy consumption at the sender side by learning the wake-up times of neighboring nodes, as well as the clock drifts compared to neighboring nodes
- Burst forwarding for better throughput
- ML-based channel hopping and acknowledged broadcast frames for higher reliability
- High MAC layer security
  - Authentication and encryption of frames via pairwise session keys
  - Strong freshness, i.e., even delayed frames are recognized as replayed
  - Denial-of-sleep-resilient medium access control
  - Denial-of-sleep-resilient pairwise session key establishment

## Code structure

- [os/services/akes](https://github.com/kkrentz/contiki-ng/tree/master/os/services/akes)
  - Contains the adaptive key establishment scheme (AKES)
- [os/net/mac/csl](https://github.com/kkrentz/contiki-ng/tree/master/os/net/mac/csl)
  - Contains the CSL MAC protocol

## Supported Platforms

- CC2538-based platforms
- [Cooja](https://github.com/kkrentz/cooja) motes

## TODOs

- I am working to add support for CC13xx/CC26xx
- Currently, this CSL implementation is limited to `macCslInterval=0`. This is to obviate data request frames and to minimize the duration of periodic wake ups. However, some platforms do not support `macCslInterval=0`. Support for `macCslInterval!=0` is hence desirable. For securing data request frames, we may echo truncated OTP bits
- Autoconfigure CCA threshold
- Autoconfigure output power
- Disable or accelerate wake ups on mains-powered devices, such as border routers
